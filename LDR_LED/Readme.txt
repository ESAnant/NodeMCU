This is a simple program which interfaces a LDR sensor with a LED.
A Light Dependent Resistor (also known as a photoresistor or LDR) is a device whose resistivity is a function of the incident electromagnetic radiation. Hence, they are light-sensitive devices. They are also called as photoconductors, photoconductive cells or simply photocells.
When the resistance is least at night(dark) the LED starts glowing and when dawn breaks and light is detected the LED turns OFF.
This is used in night lamps as it helps save power and time.
It also automates the process which makes it easier to mantain.
