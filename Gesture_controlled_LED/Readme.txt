This is a code for controlling a actuator using IR sensor as a gesture controlled switch.

In this case we are using a LED as the actuator which turn on when a object is dectected near it.
It only turns off when an object is detected again.
One can use this mechanism to control many types of actuators such as LED, motor, buzzer etc.
