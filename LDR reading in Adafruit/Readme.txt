This program utilizes a LDR sensor which is connected to a cloud server "Adafruit" and logs the data that it collects to the server 
which can be monitored from anywhere in the world.
A Light Dependent Resistor (also known as a photoresistor or LDR) is a device whose resistivity is a function of the incident electromagnetic radiation. 
Hence, they are light-sensitive devices.The resistance decreases when it is dark and increases as the incident light intensity increases.
Using this principal a bulb (LED in this case) can be interfaced with the LDR which turns on when the LDR sensor is placed in a dark place and
turn back off when light is back.
This has many real world applications such as in streets lights and headlights in vehicles.
