This folder containes the codes for the blink program for both Common Anode Type and Common Cathode Type RGB.
NOTE:
You cannot distinguish between the common cathode and common anode type by just looking at the RGB led because both look same. You will have to make the connections to see that either it is common cathode or common anode.
