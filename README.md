# NodeMCU
Some simple projects using NodeMCU ESP8266.

NodeMCU is an open-source Lua based firmware and development board specially targeted for IoT based Applications. It includes firmware that runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which is based on the ESP-12 module.

These projects are written in Arduino IDE and can be used for arduino MCU boards by changing the pin configuration accordingly.
